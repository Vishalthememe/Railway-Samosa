First remove the spring roll sheets out of the freezer and leave it to thaw. Place it inside a damp cloth, so that the sheets don't dry out.
Then, heat oil in a large pan and add the onion, salt. Saute until the onion is slightly wilted.
Now, add all the masala powders ( turmeric, red chilli, coriander, jeera) and mix well. Saute for a further 1 min and turn off the flame.
Add the chopped coriander leaves and coarsely ground poha to the onion mixture. Mix well until combined. Leave the mixture to cool down and come to room temperature.
Heat the oil in a kadai for frying. Also, mix the all purpose flour with sufficient water to make a thick paste. Now, cut the spring roll sheets into rectangles of about 1.5 inches width. My spring roll sheet was large enough to give 4 smaller sheets.
Now, take a small portion of the filling, place it in the rectangular sheet and fold it in the form of a triangle. Use the all purpose flour to seal loose edges. Refer to the pics below or the video above for the exact steps to fold the samosa.
Once the oil is hot, fry the samosa in batches until nicely golden. Drain the excess oil in paper napkin.
Enjoy hot.
